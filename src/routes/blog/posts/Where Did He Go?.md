Where did he go?

    When I first visited San Quentin, I was surprised how little I felt surprised. Perhaps it is the principled and distinguished environment of UC Berkeley or my fleeting interactions with “real people” at the school, but I was expecting something vastly different from what I encountered as I passed through those chained gates.
    Prison is supposed to hold *criminals*, folks who the carnival mirror of law and order have deemed irreparably damned. In Redwood City and East Palo Alto I knew these alleged criminals who were often sent away from my neighborhood and school after brushes with the law. Perhaps I thought them different, kids like me who got unlucky and were not smart enough to get away with their crimes. As it turns out, they truly were *criminals*, just like the men sleeping in those 8x9 concrete cells at San Quentin. This realization struck me as odd, I assumed the kids like me were the exception rather than the rule. The poor souls stuck within California’s vast and dark prison system were all at one point simply stupid kids who I may have encountered at a party or on the bart.
    I’ve known these kids to be messed up, I thought it was the natural way. Trouble at home, childhood trauma, inattentive or absent parents, and an environment that emphasizes rebellious lawbreaking as the only escape from their dratted homelife. When reviewing Steve Brooks’ article, I understood the scientific nature behind this lawbreaking. “Adverse childhood experiences” entered a Berkeley lexicon far detached from the common-sense nature of life in the Bay. However, as a student studying molecular and cellular biology, I understand the use case for utilizing ACE’s in rehabilitative treatment. However, may it be the cynic in me, or perhaps the realist — I didn’t think it would work.
    On that tour of San Quentin I encountered men I knew to be bullish at one point in their life. Whether it was at Red Morton community center or in a high school classroom, some men embody the hurt they have encountered. This is a deep, parasitic hurt that turns good kids into agents of their pain. However, on that tour of San Quentin, the men I encountered were *reformed*, utopian representations of Newsom’s new era of Californian justice. As I walked the halls of the prison, engaged in casual conversation with a man so open and honest about his ego and past crimes, I wondered to myself: where did he go? Where was the hunger? Where was the starvation this man once had for a new reality, for a new self? The answer is not so simple yet was carved into each man like a scarlet letter: “lifer”.

As it turns out, these men didn’t have a choice to reform, the system had done it for them. If he were out, his friends, family, perhaps even I would have called him soft. A man who had let the system break the dog within. This instinctive thought on my end led me into a series of internal questioning regarding my ego as a free man looking down upon one who wasn’t. But then again, who wouldn’t break? Nay, the better question: Did the system work?  
 According to the CDCR, prison personnel, and perhaps the men themselves – yes. For me, I haven't quite made up my mind. Should a man be forced to “break,” through the damnation of his life to legalized slavery only for us to redeem his name as _reformed_? Perhaps I’m being too critical.  
 Looking back at Brooks’ article and "The Work” documentary, the sociological progress made by throwing deeply held childhood traumas (ACE’s if you were to ask me at school) into the public forum seemed obvious. As the logic goes, the lost child responds to those that have found the way out. This is why young men join gangs, commit crimes, or pledge a fraternity. In prison, it is not the coercive or “rehabilitative” force of the institution that determines a young man’s fate, but the culture within those incarcerated. If the culture, from the top down, embraces the root cause of their pain and lawbreaking, those imprisoned youths with only a few years on their sentence may come out with a different point of view. On a statistical level, this strategy would probably result in a marginally lower recidivism rate; only _if_ these sociologists were successful in changing the prison culture.  
 Then again, life on the outside is tough and old habits die hard. Who's to say acknowledging the pain pushes it away instead of giving these men a psychological validation for their crimes. In short, if the childhood trauma has already destroyed me, can I go back?  
 This is not a question I expect an answer to. The California carceral system is a vast, lumbering beast that rarely responds to an individual plea for acquittal. In my view, we can only do so much when community opinion and legal discourse move at only the speed one man can cut through two layers of red tape and see another strewn up. To this end, despair is useless. In all my pondering about the right and wrong, efficacy and optimization of these strategies, only one question remains: Are we doing _something_?  
 As I have seen first hand and through these digital mediums, the answer is — yes. And for that I applaud.
