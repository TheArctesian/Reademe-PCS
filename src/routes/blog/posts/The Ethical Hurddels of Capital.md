Collapse theory and accelerationism stand at the center of contemporary critique, revealing how the foundations of liberal political systems have created a self-consuming cycle where the snake devours its own tail.

Thomas Hobbes laid the groundwork for this Leviathan, transforming egoism into a political system (liberalism). Yet human beings are not inherently egoistic—such behavior contradicts our natural sociality. Egoism represents an attitude of power, not biology; we are evolutionarily adapted for collective survival. The ethical frameworks that emerged from this tradition—liberalism, social Darwinism, lex talionis, and utilitarianism—all address merely the symptoms of power relations rather than their causes, having been formulated under systems of oppression.

These ideologies were canonized in the phrase that grants every individual the right to "pursue their happiness," as reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. Under this system, the objective measure of happiness became wealth, and as Bentham argued, the right to property must remain inviolable.

Malthus contributed by "biologizing" these power dynamics, framing humanity's challenges as a mathematical asymmetry between resources and population. This perspective positioned poverty as an inevitable consequence of limited resources rather than questioning resource allocation. His essay on population offered a disturbing "final solution": the elimination of "inferior stock."

Social Darwinism, refined by Galton and weaponized by Nazi Germany and American eugenics movements, rationalized these ethics. The resulting genocide, sterilization campaigns, and state-sponsored selective breeding programs trace their intellectual lineage to the unresolved tensions in Plato's Republic. The implementation of these ethics cost millions of lives, with Marx himself falling victim to this ideological framework.

"From this negative, critical perspective, particularly Auschwitz can only be understood as the ultimate consequence of liberal ideology in the tradition of Hobbes, Mandeville, de Sade, Bentham, Malthus, and others," whose "naturalization and biologization of the social" represent a "historical layer of Auschwitz." We should not forget the inscription on the gates of Auschwitz—_Arbeit macht frei_ ("work sets you free")—which both originated from an 1873 novel by Lorenz Diefenbach and alludes to John 8:31-32.

While Malthus has been repeatedly disproven, his prediction of resource crises may still materialize through different mechanisms. The coming catastrophe will primarily affect the 99% who have failed to extract sufficient abstract labor value to escape this approaching reckoning. Many will perish in resource wars, ideological conflicts, natural disasters, and the famines that follow.

Hitler faced similar pressures when invading Poland after failing to replicate Roosevelt's New Deal. Having exhausted the Weimar Republic's resources, he necessarily imposed a war economy. His propaganda minister Goebbels developed modern advertising techniques, transforming the specter haunting Europe into a spectacle. This merely delayed capitalism's collapse under its contradictions, at the cost of 55 million lives and the devastation of three continents.

The reformist left, following Bernstein's revisionism, incorporated revolution into the capitalist machine. In doing so, they forgot what they were fighting against. Their strategic compromises loaded the bullets that killed revolutionary figures like Trotsky, Guevara, and Luxemburg. These parliamentary socialists sacrificed revolutionary potential for bourgeois respectability, converting class struggle into electoral politics. Their betrayal was not merely tactical but metaphysical—a violation of dialectical negation itself.

They surrendered control of abstract labor, allowing central banks to appropriate wealth by decree. Instead of meaningful economic control, the working class received consumer goods and propaganda. Meanwhile, Nixon severed capital's connection to material reality when abandoning the gold standard, enabling power to completely subsume economic relations. Semiocapitalism socialized the masses to worship the machine and embody its core ethics.

While not matching capitalism's crimes, the Bolsheviks replaced the capitalist class with a tyrannical bureaucracy. Their struggle for survival forced them to adopt capitalist ethics and repeat similar atrocities to compete with hostile capitalist powers. The transfer of production means to the Bolshevik bureaucracy required its own ethical framework, creating new power dynamics that distorted human relations. The Soviet dream ultimately collapsed under its contradictions, removing barriers that had constrained market forces.

The post-war transition back to capitalism initially preserved elements of social democracy. Nature had been so thoroughly violated that a temporary reprieve from power's hypnotic influence emerged. Welfare states developed, functioning as material concessions to pacify the masses. The post-war economic miracle still exploited colonial labor, but higher taxation (94% for America's top bracket in 1964) and regulatory barriers temporarily constrained capitalism's destructive tendencies, reducing resource misallocation.

When Nixon and Kissinger destabilized economic reality by abandoning the gold standard, they broke capitalism's tie to nature. Reagan and Thatcher subsequently destroyed remaining safeguards, invoking the ethics of Locke, Mill, Bentham, Rousseau, Voltaire, Kant, and America's founders to reintroduce liberalism to capitalism—creating what we now call neoliberalism. The barriers established during post-war clarity were dismantled, facilitating financial capitalism reinforced by market spectacle that ensures its survival and growth.

As we enter the modern age, this analysis takes a darker turn. The left is amorphis, we have no cannon to base ourselves on. The Athropnoinc acdemics focus only on the collapse of capital and what is after, Nick Land and the accelerationists channel the ethic of Darwin and Scientific Captalism to excuse the horror of it's consequence.
